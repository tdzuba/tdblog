You know that particular genre of "HI I'M HERE NEW BLOG AAAAAA" post that starts every new blog?

This is that post.

I'd been sitting on this idea for a long time. Finally, in a Golden-Girls-induced fit of not wanting to go to bed, I just decided to go ahead and make a thing. Thanks, [Amanda Visconti][amanda-visconti], for your [awesome tutorial][tutorial]!

So why now? Why this?

I read *a lot* of internet. I don't know how many RSS feeds I subscribe to.[^1] I literally have 50 podcasts in [Overcast][overcast] and I even listen to some of them. Twitter is a thing that exists.

All of that to say, my brain is too full. Every now and then, I want to let a thing out of it, and Twitter is too short.[^2] So this is a place for those things to go and be free.

I'm not sure what all will live here yet. Probably some library stuff. My CV should have a home? I also something Think Things about my internet readings, so I might put them here? \*gestures vaguely\*

Anyway, this was my excuse to put a thing here. Maybe I'll publish it? Maybe it won't see the light of day?

So who are you, New Blog? Hell if I know, but you exist now. Good job existing!





[^1]: RSS, y'all. It's still the best. (#ripgooglereader) But [Feedbin][feedbin] has taken up the mantle beautifully!
[^2]: Also I have Thoughts about Twitter and why I don't post there very much. That's another blog post.[^3]
[^3]: Am I already promising more posts? Oh, dear. This *is* that post. Also footnotes in footnotes. I'm kicking the tires, ok!?
